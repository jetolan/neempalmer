# neempalmer pipeline




# INSTALL:
# python setup.py install
#
# You'll also need to get the module: semantics.py from Jamie or Raj
# which contains the semantics API code and key





# RUN:
#
# You shoul'd be able to fetch data running:
#
# python upper_data.py <company>
# OR:
# >>from upper_data import fetch
# >>fetch ('<company>')
#
# e.g., where <company>='Movado'
#
# This will create csv files and plot the offers data.
#
# Note that getting the data is fairly slow due to Semantics API call limits
